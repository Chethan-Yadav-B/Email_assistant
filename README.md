This is specially made for visually challenged people 
As the title suggests, the application will be a web-based application for visually impaired persons using IVR- Interactive voice response,
thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform all the other useful tasks.
The system will prompt the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same.
The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice and mouse click only.
